Welcome to WebPerl!
===================


WebPerl uses the power of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and
[Emscripten](http://emscripten.org/) to let you run Perl in the browser!

WebPerl does not translate your Perl code to JavaScript, instead, it is
a port of the `perl` binary to WebAssembly, so that you have the full
power of Perl at your disposal!

**Notice: WebPerl is very much in beta.**
Some things may not work yet, and parts of the API may still change.
Your feedback is always appreciated!

[**New: Experimental Perl 6 Support**](perl6.html)

```html
<script src="webperl.js"></script>
<script type="text/perl">

print "Hello, Perl World!\n";  # goes to JavaScript console by default

js('document')->getElementById('my_button')
	->addEventListener('click', sub {
		js('window')->alert("You clicked the button!");
	} );
</script>
```

Quick Start
-----------

- Prerequisites: `perl` (a recent version is recommended, e.g. v5.26 and up),
  and [`cpanm`](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus) to easily install
  dependencies (otherwise, see the file `cpanfile` for the dependencies and
  use the module installer of your choce).

- In a shell:
  
      $ wget https://github.com/haukex/webperl/releases/download/v0.09-beta/webperl_prebuilt_v0.09-beta.zip
      $ unzip webperl_prebuilt_v0.09-beta.zip
      $ cd webperl_prebuilt_v0.09-beta
      $ cpanm --installdeps .
      $ plackup webperl.psgi
      HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/

- Then point your browser at <http://localhost:5000/webperl_demo.html>
  and have a look at its source. The ZIP archive also contains several
  other examples, which you can access at <http://localhost:5000/>.

You may also host the contents of the above ZIP archive on a webserver of your
choice, or some browsers will support opening the files locally; both are
described in [Serving WebPerl](using.html#serving-webperl).
(Note: In `webperl_demo.html`, you'll likely see "AJAX Failed!", which is to be
expected since your webserver won't know how to handle the example AJAX request.)

Have fun!

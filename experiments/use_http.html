<title>WebPerl Sync HTTP Demo</title>

<!--
This is a demo of dynamically loading modules via synchronous
XMLHttpRequests.

WARNING: Please note that https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/ says:
"Synchronous XMLHttpRequest outside of workers is in the process of
being removed from the web platform as it has detrimental effects to
the end userâ€™s experience. (This is a long process that takes many
years.)"

The method was first described by LanX at
https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1225490
Thank you! :-)
